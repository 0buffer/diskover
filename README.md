# diskover - Elasticsearch file system crawler and Kibana disk usage analyzer

![diskover](docs/diskover.png?raw=True)

diskover is a file system crawler that helps index your files in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) and visualize your disk usage in [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana). It crawls and indexes your files on a local or remote server using nfs or cifs. File metadata is bulk added and streamed into Elasticsearch allowing you to **visualize your data in Kibana without having to wait until the crawl is finished**. diskover is written in Python and runs in Linux, OS X/macOS and Windows.

#### Config file

diskover will read a local config file `diskover.cfg`. **It needs to be in the same directory as `diskover.py`**.

Here you can exclude any directories and files you don't want to index separated by `,` (**spaces after comma are treated as part of file/directory name**).

Elasticsearch hostname (endpoint), port and index name are also set here. If you are using AWS ES, set `aws = True` and `port = 443` and set the host to the endpoint in your AWS ES console. If you are running Elasticsearch on your localhost or lan, comment out or set `aws = False` and the default port is `9200`. **If you installed Elasticsearch X-Pack, uncomment and set user/password for http-auth**.

Lines beginning with `;` are comments and ignored by diskover.

```
[excluded_dirs]
; directories you want to exclude from crawl
dirs = .snapshot,DO_NOT_DELETE,Databases

[excluded_files]
; files you want to exclude from crawl
files = Thumbs.db,.DS_Store,._.DS_Store,.localized,desktop.ini

[elasticsearch]
; uncomment the below three lines if you are using AWS ES
;aws = True
;host = search-diskover-es-cluster-eg3yztrvzb6qucroyyjk2vokza.ap-northeast-1.es.amazonaws.com
;port = 443
; below two lines are for local ES, comment out if you are using AWS ES
host = localhost
port = 9200
; uncomment the below two lines if you installed X-Pack, for http-auth
;user = elastic
;password = changeme
; index name for ES, cli arg overwrites this
indexname = diskover-2017.04.22
```

#### Speeding up crawl times

diskover **skips empty directories and empty files** and will **only index files >= `modified time` and >= `minimum file size`** from the command line options. Excluding certain files/directories will help speed up crawl times as well. **Running with verbose logging will increase crawl times**.

For example, if you wanted to find and index files that are >= 10 MB that have been modified >= 180 days ago, you could run diskover with:

```sh
$ cd /path/you/want/to/crawl
$ sudo python /path/to/diskover.py -m 180 -s 10
```

You could also speed up the crawl by running multiple `diskover.py` processes and bulk loading into the same `diskover-<name>` index in Elasticsearch. Below is a diagram showing this example.

![diskover-diagram](docs/diskover-diagram.png?raw=True)

#### Benchmarks

Here are some benchmarks running on my Macbook Pro, this includes time to crawl my local filesystem and index in Elasticsearch (in seconds) using the default of 2 threads and single `diskover.py` running.

```
Directories Crawled: 10001
Files Indexed: 10000
Elapsed time: 16.2423961163

Directories Crawled: 100001
Files Indexed: 100000
Elapsed time: 167.5496099
```


### Elasticsearch

#### Indices

diskover creates an index with the name from the config file or from the cli option `-i`. **If an existing index exists with the same name, it will be deleted and a new index created, unless `-n or --nodelete` cli argument is used**. 

If you are doing crawls every week for example, you could name the indices diskover-2017.04.09, diskover-2017.04.16, diskover-2017.04.23, etc. **Index names are required to be `diskover-<string>`**.

#### Append data to existing index

If you are running concurrent `diskover.py` processes you will need to use the `-n or --nodelete` cli argument to append  data to an existing index. See above diagram for example.

#### Duplicate files

![kibana-screenshot](docs/kibana-dashboard-dupes-screenshot.png?raw=True)

If you run `diskover.py` using the `--tagdupes` flag, files which are duplicates (based on same filehash field) will have their `is_dupe` field set to `true`. Default for `is_dupe` is `false`.

#### Generated fields

diskover creates the following fields:

|         Field        |                Description                  |                    Example                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `last_modified`      | Last modification date                      | `2017-03-15T19:26:28`                       |

| `filename`           | Original file name                          | `"mypic.png"`                               |
| `extension`          | Original file name extension                | `"png"`                                     |

| `path_full`          | Actual real path name                       | `"/tmp/dir1/dir2/mypic.png"`                |
| `owner`              | Owner name                                  | `"cpark"`                                   |
| `group`              | Group name                                  | `"staff"`                                   |
| `hardlinks`          | Hardlink count                              | `1`                                         |
| `inode`              | Inode number                                | `652490`                                    |
| `filehash`           | MD5 hash of file                            | `3a6949b4b74846a482016d0779560327`          |
| `tag`                | File tag for diskover web                   | `untagged`                                  |
| `is_dupe`            | Duplicate file                              | `false`                                     |

**Note: All date fields are stored as UTC time in Elasticsearch. Kibana displays dates using your local timezone.**

#### Filehash

In order to speed up crawl times, a md5 hash for each file is made from combining the strings `filename+filesize+last_modified` and hashing that string, rather than the contents of the file. This seems to be a fast high-level way to create a hash of the file. **You should run the md5 command on the files to compare their hashes before you delete the dupes**.

### Kibana

For the index pattern use `diskover-*`. **Make sure the `Index contains time-based events` box is `unchecked`** when you create index patterns. You could also use `modified_time` as your timestamp if you want to filter using time ranges in Kibana. This could be useful if you didn't run the crawl using an old `-m` modified file time.

#### diskover dashboard

![kibana-screenshot](docs/kibana-dashboardlight-screenshot.png?raw=True)

To use the diskover dashboards, import the saved objects file `export.json` into Kibana for the dashboard visualizations. In Kibana go to `Management > Saved Objects > Import`.

If nothing is showing in the dashboard, go to `Management > Index Patterns > diskover-*` and then hit the `refresh icon`.

#### Kibana Field Formatting

This will help make the dashboard easier to read like in the screenshot for filesize and dates. In Kibana go to `Management > Index Patterns > diskover-*`. In the `Fields tab` click the `edit icon` under controls column for `filesize` field. Change the format to `bytes` and click `Update Field`. For `access_time, modified_time, and change_time`, edit the fields and change the format to `date` and set the format pattern to `MM-DD-YYYY, HH:mm` and click `Update Field`.

#### Kibana Search Filters

Once you have imported the `export.json` into Kibana, in Kibana's `Discover` page click `open`. There will be a few saved searches in there to help you filter for old files and find duplicate files.

Here are some filter examples:

* `last_modified:[now-5y TO now-3M]` filters files that haven't been modified in over 3 months and less than 5 years
* `last_modified:[now-5y TO now-6M] AND last_access:[now-5y TO now-6M]` filters files that haven't been modified or accessed in over 6 months and less than 5 years
* `last_modified:[now-5y TO now-1y] AND last_access:[now-5y TO now-1y]` filters files that haven't been modified or access in over 1 year and less than 5 years
* `extension:(jpg OR gif OR png OR tif OR tiff OR dpx OR exr OR psd OR bmp OR tga)` filters for image files
* `extension:(aif OR iff OR m3u OR m4a OR mid OR mp3 OR mpa OR wav OR wma)` filters for audio files
* `extension:(asf OR avi OR flv OR m4v OR mov OR mp4 OR mpg OR rm OR vob OR wmv)` filters for video files
* `extension:(cache OR tmp OR temp OR bak OR old)` filters for temp files
* `extension:(7z OR deb OR gz OR pkg OR rar OR rpm OR tar OR zip OR zipx)` filters for compressed files
* `filename:img*.dpx` filters for image sequence img001.dpx, img002.dpx, im003.dpx, etc.
* `is_dupe:true` filters for duplicate files

#### Tracking directory tree size over time

To track a directory tree's change in size over time, create a new index each time crawling from the top-level directory of the project.

Every week or month for example: diskover-PROJA-2017.05.10, diskover-PROJA-2017.05.17, etc.

Then create a new Kibana index pattern `diskover-PROJA-*` to filter to just those indices.

To visualy see the change over time, create a line chart in Kibana using `sum of filesize` for `y-axis` and set `x-axis` to `date-histogram` using `indexing_date` field. Set `interval` to `weekly` or `monthly`.

### X-Pack

#### Graphs

To create graphs you need to install [X-Pack](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/x-pack). After X-Pack is installed, edit `diskover.cfg` for http auth credentials since X-Pack adds http auth to Elasticsearch and Kibana.

#### Dupes graph

![kibana-screenshot](docs/kibana-graph-dupes-screenshot.png?raw=True)

* index pattern: `diskover-*`
* verticies field source #1: `filehash` set to `50 max terms per hop`
* verticies field source #2: `inode` set to `50 max terms per hop`
* verticies field source #3: `path_parent` set to `50 max terms per hop`
* settings: uncheck `Significant links` and set `Certainty to 1`
* search filter: `hardlinks: 1 AND is_dupe: true`

#### Hardlinks graph

![kibana-screenshot](docs/kibana-graph-hardlinks-screenshot.png?raw=True)

* index pattern: `diskover-*`
* verticies field source #1: `path_parent` set to `50 max terms per hop`
* verticies field source #2: `inode` set to `50 max terms per hop`
* settings: uncheck `Significant links` and set `Certainty to 1`
* search filter: `hardlinks: >1`
