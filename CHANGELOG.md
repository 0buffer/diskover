# Diskover Change Log

## [1.2.6] = 2017-10-02
### fixed
- absolute paths in excluded directory list not being skipped in crawl
- crawl sometimes hanging at end when using more than default number of threads
- duplicates count at end of tagdupes showing wrong number of dupes tagged in Elasticsearch
- keyboard interupt sometimes not working when stopping tagdupes

## [1.2.5] = 2017-09-30
### added
- elasticsearch timeout setting in config diskover.cfg
### fixed
- increased timeout to 30 secconds for finding dupes using scroll api, default for Elasticsearch python client is 10 sec which was causing crash searching index containing many duplicate hashes
- bug causing directory's to get indexed as file type documents in Elasticsearch and also excludes being ignored (due to changes in v1.2.4)
### changed
- combined excludes (dirs/files) into one group "excludes" in config diskover.cfg
- increased timeout from 10 seconds (default) to 30 seconds for Elasticsearch transport class in elasticsearchConnect function

## [1.2.4] = 2017-09-28
### added
- check if path exists before crawling
- index single file using "-f or --file" cli argument
### changed
- no longer using python 3 built in os scandir, requires scandir module same as python 2

## [1.2.3] = 2017-09-24
### added
- more debug output for file and excludes
### changed
- decreased crawl time by creating Queue for subdirs in rootdir and using half the threads to recursively crawl down those paths. Previously only the main thread was used to crawl down tree from rootdir
- reduced cpu usage by removing stdout flush for progress bar
### fixed
- occasionally at end of crawl few remaining files in Queue would not get bulk added to ES
- unicode issues

## [1.2.2] = 2017-09-22
### added
- can now set minimum file size using '-s' or '--minsize' for duplicate file finding '--tagdupes'
- '--mtime' cli option for modified time now also checks directory mtime and skips adding to queue
### changed
- decreased crawl times by modifying Elasticsearch bulk item size, reducing file stat calls, reducing queue wait sleep time
- filelist and dirlist now gets bulk added to ES and emptied when at 1000 or more items, previously dirlist would get bulk added after all directories were crawled and filelist was bulk added after each directory
- reduced file stat calls by storing entry.stat() and os.stat(path) into stat var and using it for different stat
- tagdupes duplicate finder will now search ES for all results and dupe finding is done in php rather than ES aggregate buckets tophits. This allows to find all dupes and not limit of 10000 hashgroups.
- excluded_dirs can have absolute paths as well as just directory names
- improved code for duplicate file detection
- default is now >0MB for cli option '--minsize' (min file size)
- default is now 0 for cli option '--mtime' (min days old)
- removed global variables for total file counts and replaced with local for each thread, totals are calculated at end of crawl stats output
### fixed
- better handling of unicode, unicode was causing Exception errors
- crawl stats not reporting correct file count in python 2

## [1.2.1] = 2017-09-17
### changed
- progress bar for tagdupes now more accurately reflects check progress
### fixed

- path field is multi field both keyword and text, path.tree text field uses ES path hierarchy tokenizer
- nice cli flag to reduce cpu/disk io
- stats output at end of crawl/dupe check
### changed
- removed find command for building directory queue and replaced with python scandir
- set default crawl threads to 4
### fixed
